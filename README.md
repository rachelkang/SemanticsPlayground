# SemanticsPlayground
A place to experiment with accessibility APIs used in native platforms.

This is used to compare against behaviors in Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI, and closely resembles [SemanticsPage](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/blob/main/src/Controls/samples/Controls.Sample/Pages/SemanticsPage.xaml).
